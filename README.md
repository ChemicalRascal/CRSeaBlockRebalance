This is a really simple, super-basic and honestly not-well-coded set of overrides intended to shift the experience of Sea Block back a little in favour of a slightly less difficult experience, re-introducing more complex factory design choices, and the like.

Currently, the mod implements the following:

* Reverts charcoal to 2.5MJ each, 12 charcoal from every 1 wood brick. (New icon is still used, though.)

* Reverts slag recipe energy_required to 2, from 4 after April 2019 changes to Angel's Bioprocessing.

* [Optionally:] Re-enables water borers (called water pumps in-game, for now) from Bob's Plates, but removes the purified water recipe from them.

Future todo stuff:

* Possibly add a very slow deep-sea-pump replacement recipe to water borers.

* Other stuff depending on discussion, play testing.
